This repository contains two Java programming assignments focusing on object-oriented design and dynamic data structures. Each task is organized in a separate package (h1, h2) and implemented strictly according to the given specifications.

The first assignment implements a class Bruch with attributes for numerator and denominator. It includes a private method ggT that computes the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm, a public method shorten to reduce fractions to their simplest form, and a method hasSameValueAs to compare two fractions by value.

The second assignment implements a singly linked list consisting of the classes Node and SimpleList. The list uses a head node with a dummy value and supports operations such as appending elements, retrieving the first and last nodes, searching for values, inserting elements after a given value, and deleting elements. All methods ensure that the structure of the list remains consistent after each operation.
